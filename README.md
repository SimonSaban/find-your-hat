# find-your-hat

* An exercise where the challenge was to build a simple game that runs on the node environment.
* To win players need to navigate to the hat (represented by '^') without falling into a hole (represented by 'O') or step outside the field's perimeter.
* Initially the game was desinged in a way that the field's dimensions are pre-determined for the user. 
* As an extra challenge the code was extended to allow the user to define the field themselves.
* Another extra feature was included to allow the user to continue playing for as long as they like.

*User input validation could also be added to make the code more robust.*
